Title: Effect of proximity on mutually cross-feeding lactic acid bacteria in yogurt fermentation using Flux Balance Analysis

The code developed can be found under Code, with instructions on how to run the simulations. CobraToolbox V3.0 (https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/)and Metabolic models of ST and LB are required. 

Code for the toy model is under Toy Model folder

Graphs generated for Metabolite concentrations at different distances is reported in Metabolites ST and LB. The simulation was run for 20 hours at different distances.

Supplementary section has extra figures and informtion
